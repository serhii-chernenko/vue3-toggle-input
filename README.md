# Toggle Input Challenge

Your task is to create a custom toggle input component that works with v-model.

## Requirements

1. The component should take a boolean v-model that updates as expected when the toggle is clicked
2. The v-model should support a custom modifier (`binary`) that uses converts values to `1` or `0` instead of `true`/`false`

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Feel free to use TypeScript to make your component type safe if you'd like. This is NOT required however.
